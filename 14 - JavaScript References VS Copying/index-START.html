    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log(players, team)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(team)
    // team was not a copy of the team array it was a reference, so when we changed the team array it also modifies the orginal players array
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice() //makes a copy 
    console.log('team2: ', team2)

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    console.log('team3: ', team3)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    console.log('team4: ', team4)

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    console.log('team5: ', team5)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'justin',
      age: 29
    }
  
    // Not good we just have a reference to the person object so when we change the captin we mutate the orginal person object too
    // const captain = person
    // captain.age = 66

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 45})
    console.log('cap2: ', cap2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person, age: 4}
    // console.log('cap3: ', cap3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const employee = {
      fname: 'justin',
      lname: 'taylor',
      contact: {
        phone: '111-111-1111',
        email: 'jt@email.com'
      }
    }

    console.log('employee: ', employee)

    const dev = Object.assign({}, employee)
    console.log('dev: ', dev)

    // this will break the reference to the orginal object aka makes a copy
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(employee))
    dev2.contact.phone = 333
    console.log('dev2.contact: ', dev2.contact)
